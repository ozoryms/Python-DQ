    "However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers. We will combine the results for both surveys to answer the following questions\n",

    " - Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
